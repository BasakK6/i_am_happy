# i_am_happy

This project is a challenge from the
[The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)
course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

Using what we have learnt from the [I Am Rich app](https://github.com/BasakK6/i_am_rich) (lesson 3), we were assigned to build a simple Flutter app from scratch.

In this app, we were told to use the given Widget tree structure and create an app called I Am Poor.
However, we were also encouraged to customise the app as much as we can (such as changing the topic and using another illustration we like).

Honestly, creating an app named "I am Poor" made me feel rather pessimistic so I decided to create an app which is more optimistic. In the end, I came up with the "I Am Happy" title. I thought about what makes me happy the most.
I love traveling and getting to know different cultures 🚘 ✈️ 🚢 🚞 🏞 🌇.
So I found the perfect [illustration](https://icons8.com/illustrations/illustration/bonbon-happy-girl-waving-from-the-airplane-window-1) about that and displayed it in this project.
